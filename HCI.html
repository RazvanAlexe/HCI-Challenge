    <h1><u>HCI Challenge #2: Remote Communications by Alexe Razvan(3A2)</u></h1>
	<h1>1. Observe the existing affordances, visual variables and interaction flows for a given use case – for example, delivering an academic presentation or attending a specific meeting at late hours – and propose better approaches (if any). </h1>
	<p>
        <h2>Zoom</h2>
        The affordances, visual variables, and interaction flows for an academic presentation using Zoom may vary depending on the specific context and goals of the presentation. However, some common ones include:
        
        <h3>Affordances:</h3>
            <p>Screen sharing: allows the presenter to share their screen, either the entire desktop or a specific window or application, with the audience.</p>
                <p>Chat: allows participants to send text messages to each other or to the presenter.</p>
                    <p>Raise hand: allows participants to indicate that they have a question or comment.</p>
                        <p>Recording: allows the presenter to record the presentation for later playback.</p>
                            <h3>Visual variables:</h3>
                                <p>Slides: can be created in various software such as PowerPoint or Google Slides, and presented using the screen sharing feature.</p>
                                    <p>Annotation: the presenter can annotate the shared screen in real-time using Zoom's built-in annotation tools.</p>
                                        <p>Video: the presenter can include pre-recorded or live video within their presentation.</p>
                                            <p>Virtual backgrounds: the presenter can use virtual backgrounds to customize the visual appearance of their presentation.</p>
                                                <h3>Interaction flows:</h3>
                                                    <p>Introduction: the presenter introduces themselves and their topic.</p>
                                                        <p>Presentation: the presenter shares their slides and speaks about their topic while answering questions from the audience as they arise.</p>
                                                            <p>Q&A: a designated time for the audience to ask questions and engage in discussion with the presenter.</p>
                                                                <p>Conclusion: the presenter summarizes the main points of their presentation and thanks the audience for their participation.</p>
                                                                    <p>It's worth noting that Zoom offers various features and settings that can be customized to meet the specific needs of the presenter and audience. For example, the presenter can enable or disable features such as screen sharing, chat, and recording, and can adjust settings such as the size and visibility of the chat window.</p>
    </p>
    <p>
        <h2>Meet</h2>
        The affordances, visual variables, and interaction flows for an academic presentation using Google Meet may vary depending on the specific context and goals of the presentation. However, some common ones include:

        <h3>Affordances:</h3>
        <p>Screen sharing: allows the presenter to share their screen, either the entire desktop or a specific window or application, with the audience.</p>
        <p>Chat: allows participants to send text messages to each other or to the presenter.</p>
            <p>Q&A: allows the presenter to receive and answer questions from participants.</p>

    <h1>2. Compare the visual metaphors and idioms and suggest the similar ones for a text-only interaction (see CLI – Command Line Interface)</h1>
	<h2>Zoom:</h2>
        <p>"Zooming in" or "zooming out": these phrases are often used metaphorically to refer to focusing on or expanding one's perspective on a particular topic or issue.</p>
            <p>"Zoom fatigue": a term used to describe the feeling of exhaustion or burnout that can result from excessive use of video conferencing technology.</p>
                <p>"Zoom bomb": a term used to describe when uninvited guests join a Zoom meeting and disrupt the proceedings.</p>
                    <p>"On mute": a phrase commonly used during Zoom meetings to indicate that someone's microphone is turned off and they cannot be heard.</p>
                    <h2>Google Meet:</h2>
        <p>"Meet and greet": a common phrase used to describe a social gathering or event where people come together to meet and get to know each other.</p>
        <p>"Meet me halfway": a phrase used to suggest compromise or collaboration between two parties.</p>
        <p>Meeting of the minds": a phrase used to describe a productive and collaborative discussion or meeting.</p>
        <p>"Google it": a phrase commonly used to suggest using Google as a search engine to find information on a particular topic.</p>
        <h2>For a text-only interaction, some similar metaphors and idioms could be:</h2>

        <p>"Focusing in" or "focusing out": These phrases could be used to describe the act of paying attention to or ignoring specific details in a text-based conversation.</p>
        <p>"Group view": This could be a view mode in a text-based platform that shows multiple conversation threads or participants on the screen at once.</p>
        <p>"Highlighting": This could be a feature in a text-based platform that allows users to "highlight" or emphasize specific parts of a conversation, making it easier to follow.</p>
        <p>It's worth noting that text-based platforms have their own set of metaphors and idioms that are unique to their medium, such as "threading" in email or "direct messaging" on social media. The key is to choose metaphors and idioms that are intuitive and easy for users to understand.</p>
    </p>
    <h1>3. Discuss the cognitive overload in special conditions/contexts.</h1>
	<p>Multiple stimuli: Participants in a Zoom or Google Meet meeting are often faced with multiple stimuli, including audio, video, and text chat. Trying to process all of these stimuli at once can lead to cognitive overload.</p>

        <p>Technical difficulties: Technical issues such as poor audio or video quality, slow connection, or difficulty with screen sharing can lead to cognitive overload, as participants may struggle to understand what is being presented or said.</p>
        
            <p>Multitasking: Participants may be tempted to multitask during a Zoom or Google Meet meeting, such as checking email or browsing social media, which can lead to cognitive overload as they try to balance multiple tasks at once.</p>
        
                <p>Information overload: In longer meetings or presentations, participants may be presented with a large amount of information to process, leading to cognitive overload.</p>
        
        <p>Lack of breaks: Zoom or Google Meet meetings can be tiring, especially if they are long or require intense focus. A lack of breaks can lead to cognitive overload as participants become fatigued.</p>
    <h1>4. List minimum three improvements that can be made to optimize these applications from the point of view of the main audience on at least two platforms – for instance, Web + mobile native, desktop native + mobile native. Each improvement will be listed in pairs: UI/UX problem identified & solution suggested.</h1>
	<p><h2>Problem: Limited visibility of participants in large meetings</h2>
        <h3>Solution:</h3> Implement a dynamic "speaker view" option that automatically switches the focus to the current speaker, and a "grid view" option that displays all participants' video feeds in a grid format. This feature should be available on all platforms, including web, desktop, and mobile native.
        
    <h2>Problem: Difficulty in joining meetings from mobile devices</h2>
    <h3>Solution:</h3> Implement a simpler and more intuitive mobile interface that allows users to easily join meetings from their mobile devices, without requiring them to download any additional software or apps. This feature should be available on both web and mobile native platforms.
        
    <h2>Problem: Inconsistent UI across platforms</h2>
    <h3>Solution:</h3> Ensure that the UI is consistent across all platforms, including web, desktop native, and mobile native. Use a consistent color scheme, typography, and iconography, and ensure that all buttons and controls are in the same location and behave in the same way.</p>
    <h1>5. How the empiric laws (Fitts’, Hick’s, Steering) might be reconsidered/adapted in the context of multi-device interaction?</h1>
	<p><h2>Fitts' Law:</h2> In Zoom or Google Meet, Fitts' law can be applied to the design of the user interface, ensuring that buttons and controls are appropriately sized and positioned for the device being used. For example, buttons for muting or unmuting a microphone or turning on/off the camera should be large enough and positioned in a way that makes them easy to find and click on, regardless of the device being used.

        <h2>Hick's Law:</h2> In Zoom or Google Meet, Hick's law can be applied to the design of the meeting interface, ensuring that participants are presented with a manageable number of options and choices to avoid decision paralysis. For example, presenters should limit the number of slides or content presented in a single meeting, and participants should be given clear instructions and options to participate in the meeting.
        
        <h2>Miller's Law:</h2> In Zoom or Google Meet, Miller's law can be applied to the design of the meeting interface and content, ensuring that information is presented in a way that is easy to understand and remember. For example, presenters should break down complex information into smaller, more manageable pieces, and use visual aids such as charts or graphs to help participants understand the information being presented.
        
        <h2>Nielsen's Heuristics:</h2> In Zoom or Google Meet, Nielsen's heuristics can be applied to the design of the user interface and meeting experience, ensuring that the interface is consistent, efficient, and easy to use. For example, meeting controls and options should be located in a consistent place throughout the interface, and users should be provided with clear and concise instructions for using the interface and participating in the meeting.</p>
    <h1>6. List three new features that can be added to improve the experience and sketch those new features on paper and/or digitally. </h1>
	<p><h2>AI assistant:</h2> The ability to have a Artificial Intelligence type member in the conversation that can participate under conditions determined by the users. This would be easy to implement, just add another button next to the already basic set of buttons that enables AI member to be part of the participants.
        <h2>Work functionalities:</h2> Most meetings take place with the intention of a work. Most groups use some sort of shared resource type of website/software, so an improvement would be direct integration of those types of utilities (Google Docs, Github). This would be easy to implement, just add another button next to the already basic set of buttons that is the determined work link for everyone.
        <h2>Voice controlled commands:</h2> A feature that would be a simple quality of life improvement would be the ability to use voice commands to initiate certain actions: Mute, Unmute, Leave Call, etc. This would be easy to implement, just add another button next to the already basic set of buttons that enables voice activated commands.
